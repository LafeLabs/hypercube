# Trash Magic

Trash Magic is self-replicating media made from trash.  Our objective in Trash Magic is to build a world where we can build all elements of a good life locally everywhere in the world for free using only trash in our immediate environment and things we can grow.  

We begin simply working to make things from trash which replicate.
