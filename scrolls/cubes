# Cubes
 
To make one cube, cut out 12 of these from corrugated cardboard, stack them into four panels 3 layers thick and glue them using Elmer's glue:

Now cut out 3 of the bottom pieces, and stack them into a fifth glued panel.

Assemble the sides into the base as shown:

Cut out 4 inch squares, print on them, glue them to the panels, and hold it all together with rubber bands:

These cubes are now ready to be used to build robots, planters, mushroom farms, nano compost cubes, worm farms, or other machinery, technology, or horticulture.  They can be stacked to make much larger fractal structures.
