Trash Magic cards in the Geometron Hypercube are 3 inches by 4.5 inches, and stack in the [cubes](scrolls/cubes).  Cards are generally cut from cardboard. They can represent anything.  They are a communication medium: we use them to point to information which can be carried from one place to another in the Geometron Hypercube.  Add an icon to a card.  Add an email address, social media account, phone number, url, QR code, physical address or location, logo, brand, list, hashtag, or any other small element of printed communication.  Take a card, carry it to another Trash Magic Space, and drop it off. 

The Trash Magic Cards are like packets of information on the Internet.
