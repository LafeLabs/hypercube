# The Geometron Hypercube

Join the Trash Robot Network to build a world of freely replicating things from trash!  Our objective is to build an entire new civilization from things we can grow and from trash, using the tools of geometry.  Our language is Geometron, which is based on the fundamental symmetries of the Universe.  Geometron represents a revolution from a numbers-based information technology to one based entirely on geometric constructions.  Geometry is what we use to create symbols for communication with people as well as to construct and program machines which build physical products.  

The Geometron Hypercube is our primary product" on which all other technology is based.  We create 4 inch cubes from cardboard trash we find in our environment.  We use these cubes as literal building blocks both for our mechanical technology like the printers and other robots we use for fabrication. We also use them to grow living things which we can eat as well as use for other technological purposes like mycelium-based circuits.  Cubes are stacked, moved, organized, edited, composted, and traded, and form the basis of the economy of our new world.  

Taken together, the sum total of the cubes, and their infrastructure for replication are called the Geometron Hypercube.  This is a combination of physical information in the form of the cubes and more abstract informational constructions which make up the Geometron language.
