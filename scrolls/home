# The Geometron Hypercube

The Cube is self-replicating geometry constructed from cardboard trash.    The Hypercube is the set of all the cubes we make, a shared Universe of cardboard cubes.

The cube contains tools to replicate itself: box cutters, sharpies, [rulers](scrolls/rulers), and [shapes for geometric constructions](scrolls/shapes).

We use triangles of various special shapes to create patterns showing the fundamental symmetries of the Universe.  [These can be made from laser cut acrylic using patterns from this web page](scrolls/shapes).  Also we use [laser cut acrylic rulers](scrolls/rulers) if we can. But without special tools, we can use a protractor, printing, tracing, or classical geometry to construct shapes with angles of 45 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 36 and 72 degrees.   These angles give us insight into the most common symmetries we find in both Nature and Technology.  

We begin with raw corrugated cardboard.

This is cut into 4 inch squares:

Squares without any paint/coating/finish/color are cut to the side shapes and bottom shape, and we need 5 faces for the outside, which are unmodified 4 inch squares.  

Use a 36 degree triangle to color one finished side in with a fractal pentagram structure, which shows how fivefold symmetry relates to the Golden Ratio:

Use triangles with 30, 60, and 120 degrees to color another side in with a fractal six pointed star showing how sixfold symmetry and scaling by the square root of 3 are structured.

Join the Trash Robot Network to build a world of freely replicating things from trash!  Our objective is to build an entire new civilization from things we can grow and from trash, using the tools of geometry.  Our language is [Geometron, which is based on the fundamental symmetries of the Universe](scrolls/geometron).  Geometron represents a revolution from a numbers-based information technology to one based entirely on geometric constructions.  Geometron is what we use to create symbols for communication with people as well as to construct and program machines which build physical products.  

The Geometron Hypercube is our primary "product" on which all our other technology is based.  We create 4 inch cubes from cardboard trash we find in our environment.  We use these cubes as literal building blocks both for our mechanical technology like the printers and other robots we use for fabrication. We also use them to grow living things which we can eat as well as use for other technological purposes like mycelium-based circuits.  Cubes are stacked, moved, organized, edited, composted, and traded, and form the basis of the economy of our new world.  

Taken together, the sum total of the cubes, and their infrastructure for replication are called the Geometron Hypercube.  This is a combination of physical information in the form of the cubes and more abstract informational constructions which make up the Geometron language.
