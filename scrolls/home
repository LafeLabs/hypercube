# The Geometron Hypercube

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/8-cell.gif)


The Cube is self-replicating geometry constructed from cardboard trash.    The Hypercube is the set of all the cubes we make, a shared Universe of cardboard cubes.

The cube contains tools to replicate itself: box cutters, sharpies, [rulers](scrolls/rulers), and [shapes for geometric constructions](scrolls/shapes).

We use triangles of various special shapes to create patterns showing the fundamental symmetries of the Universe.  [These can be made from laser cut acrylic using patterns from this web page](scrolls/shapes).  Also we use [laser cut acrylic rulers](scrolls/rulers) if we can. But without special tools, we can use a protractor, printing, tracing, or classical geometry to construct shapes with angles of 45 degrees, 30 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees, 36 and 72 degrees.   These angles give us insight into the most common symmetries we find in both Nature and Technology.  

We begin with raw corrugated cardboard.

This is cut into 4 inch squares:

Squares without any paint/coating/finish/color are cut to the side shapes and bottom shape, and we need 5 faces for the outside, which are unmodified 4 inch squares.  

Use a 36 degree triangle to color one finished side in with a fractal pentagram structure, which shows how fivefold symmetry relates to the Golden Ratio:

Use triangles with 30, 60, and 120 degrees to color another side in with a fractal six pointed star showing how sixfold symmetry and scaling by the square root of 3 are structured.

A third side is based on a study of the square root of two and fourfold symmetry:

We put all this together along with the side and base layouts to get the five finished faces:

side layout, on a 0.5 inch grid(we need 12 of these per cube):

An assembled side piece with 6x1 inch rulers for scale:

We cut 3 of these out per cube to make the base:

Those are stacked and glued:

Squares can be transformed into sides one by one by hand:

Assembly with glue fits it all together:

If you have access to a laser cutter, there are patterns you can use to cut here:

# Trash Magic 

The objective of Trash Magic is to build a world of freely replicating media which is used to create and replicate all elements of a comfortable life for all people using only trash and things we can grow.  To that end, we build media from trash and replicate it.  This self-replicating trash-based media can be used to replicate anything: ideas, things, groups, systems, technologies, organizations, projects, research, media, food, medicine, culture, stories, and living things.  

# Trash Magic Geometron Hypercube Cards

Cards are 3x4.5 inches, divided up into 1.5 inch squares.  Icons are printed in squares with the [Geometron Icon Trash Robot Printer](scrolls/printers).  Cards are carried from one cube to another in the Geometron Hypercube, the set of all [Geometron Cubes](scrolls/cubes) built worldwide.  Using physical cards in conjunction with media we put on both local and global web servers we can point to any information of any kind.  A domain name can point to a web page which can point to a place which can have more physical media pointing to a server which can hold any media in any format of any size.  This represents an extension of the World Wide Web into the physical world, printed on trash.  Passerby bring us cardboard trash and we cut it up into cards, divide the cards, print on them, put them in cubes, and share them with the whole Hypercube. 

Cards can be used to:

 - find people to connect with
 - spread messages, memes, philosophies
 - spread media 
 - replicate things in Trash Magic
 - promote a brand
 - advertise a product or service
 - build game boards in the physical world
 - represent business transactions
 - represent mutual aid 
 - represent philosophical concepts
 - direct to a place(park, corner, bridge, tunnel, shelter, house, business, rest stop, library, community center, makerspace, art gallery, coffee shop, garden, grove, warehouse, ford, dock, swamp, beach, etc.)
 - build a collaborative game board on flat surfaces. This is a form of physical social media entirely built on trash and geometry.

Join the Trash Robot Network to build a world of freely replicating things from trash!  Our objective is to build an entire new civilization from things we can grow and from trash, using the tools of geometry.  Our language is [Geometron, which is based on the fundamental symmetries of the Universe](scrolls/geometron).  Geometron represents a revolution from a numbers-based information technology to one based entirely on geometric constructions.  Geometron is what we use to create symbols for communication with people as well as to construct and program machines which build physical products.  

The Geometron Hypercube is our primary "product" on which all our other technology is based.  We create 4 inch cubes from cardboard trash we find in our environment.  We use these cubes as literal building blocks both for our mechanical technology like the printers and other robots we use for fabrication. We also use them to grow living things which we can eat as well as use for other technological purposes like mycelium-based circuits.  Cubes are stacked, moved, organized, edited, composted, and traded, and form the basis of the economy of our new world.  

Taken together, the sum total of the cubes, and their infrastructure for replication are called the Geometron Hypercube.  This is a combination of physical information in the form of the cubes and more abstract informational constructions which make up the Geometron language.
