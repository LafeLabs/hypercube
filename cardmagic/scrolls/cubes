# Cubes
 
To make one cube, cut out 12 of these from corrugated cardboard, stack them into four panels 3 layers thick and glue them using Elmer's glue:

Now cut out 3 of the bottom pieces, and stack them into a fifth glued panel.

Assemble the sides into the base as shown:

Cut out 4 inch squares, print on them, glue them to the panels, and hold it all together with rubber bands:

These cubes are now ready to be used to build robots, planters, mushroom farms, nano compost cubes, worm farms, or other machinery, technology, or horticulture.  They can be stacked to make much larger fractal structures.

Every cube we produce in the Trash Robot Network is part of the Geometron Hypercube.  Therefore to grow the Hypercube, we produce and distribute as many cubes as we can, and always evolve the cubes to make them better over time and to solve specific problems to bring us closer to Trash Magic.

Cubes are a mutual aid currency. If someone has more resources than you you can sell them a cube. If you have more resources, you can give them a cube. Either way we move the cubes through the physical social network from person to person.  Cubes are all composted and eaten eventually.  They start out building machines and art supply boxes, then eventually turn into planters, and finally rot and get composted into soil which is used to farm plants, mushrooms and worms.  Cubes can represent anything.  

Cubes can represent anything.  Any concept, place, person, brand, idea, media, machine, organism or "thing" in the most abstract sense can be represented by an icon.  We can put many icons on a cube, and can add layers and print more icons on those.  An economy based on the exchange of cubes can have much more complexity than a money-based economy.  We express complex networks of ideas using icons, and use the cube as a physical medium for transmitting physical matter both living and non-living.
